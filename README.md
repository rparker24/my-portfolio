# my-portfolio

Downloaded the Superhero bootstrap theme from Boots Watch.
Added my HTML code from my previous Portfolio site.
Minor changes such as removing style.css link and adding bootstrap.min.css link and adding the script section to the end of the body

Not entirely sure if I'm just doing the bare minimum or this was all that was asked in the hw instructions.
